# Setup

Tested on Debian Buster x86-64, Python 3.7, CPU must support Intel PT for tracing.

1. Install `cmake`, `elf.h`, `gawk`, and `perf`:

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libc6-dev gawk linux-perf
```

2. Run `./scripts/build.sh` from the root directory of this repository.

3. Install [Graph-Tool](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions).

4. Install additional Python modules:

```
pip install -Ur ./src/analysis/requirements.txt
```

5. Ensure `perf` supports Intel PT:

```
$ perf list | grep intel_pt
  intel_pt//                                         [Kernel PMU event]
```

# Usage

We will use `$REPO` to denote the root directory of this repository.

1. Record at least 1 trace:

```
$ cd $(mktemp -d)
$ $REPO/scripts/trace.sh /bin/ls
perf.data
[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.031 MB perf.data ]
```

2. Disassemble the trace:

**Note:** Disassembly may take a long time and traces may be very large.

```
$REPO/scripts/ptxed.sh
```

3. Run the analysis:

**Note:** Multiple traces of the same program can be merged together by passing
all their `*.ptxed.gz` files to `analysis.py`.

```

4. Use the generated profile with the analyzed program:

```
$REPO/scripts/hook.sh /bin/ls
```

# Profiles

Profiles are written into `$HOME/.config/uaf-defense`. They are currently
*not portable* and *do not check for file modifications*, so if you move or
update an executable or library, the profile must be regenerated.
